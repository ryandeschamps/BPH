Test Script: TS-098 - Restrict Orders to US Only

Test Scenario: As a system, I want to accept orders only from United States addresses, so that I can comply with business operational constraints.

Prerequisites:
- Shipping restriction implemented
- Country validation enabled
- Checkout process functional

Test Data:
- US Address: 123 Main St, Los Angeles, CA 90210, USA
- Canadian Address: 456 Maple Ave, Toronto, ON M5H 2N2, Canada
- UK Address: 789 High St, London, UK SW1A 1AA

Test Steps:

GIVEN the user is on the checkout page
WHEN the user enters shipping address
THEN the country field should default to "United States"
AND may only show "United States" as option
OR other countries may be disabled

GIVEN the user enters a US address
WHEN the user provides:
  - Address: "123 Main St"
  - City: "Los Angeles"
  - State: "CA"
  - ZIP: "90210"
  - Country: "United States"
AND proceeds to payment
THEN the order should be accepted
AND checkout should complete successfully

GIVEN the user tries to enter non-US address
WHEN the user selects or enters:
  - Country: "Canada"
AND tries to proceed
THEN a validation error should be displayed
AND the message should indicate "We only ship to United States addresses"
AND the user should not be able to complete checkout

GIVEN the user enters Canadian ZIP code
WHEN the user tries postal code "M5H 2N2"
THEN the system should detect non-US format
AND display error message
AND prevent order placement

GIVEN the user checks PIN code availability
WHEN the user enters a Canadian postal code on product page
THEN the system should indicate "Delivery not available. We only ship within the US."

GIVEN the address validation runs
WHEN the system validates shipping address
THEN it should verify:
  - Country is "United States"
  - State is valid US state
  - ZIP code is valid US format (5 digits or ZIP+4)

Expected Result:
- Only US addresses accepted for shipping
- Country field restricted to US
- Non-US addresses rejected
- Clear error messages displayed
- Checkout prevented for non-US orders
- ZIP code validation enforces US format

Validation Points:
- Country field defaults to US
- Non-US countries blocked or unavailable
- US address validation works
- US order completes successfully
- Non-US address triggers error
- Error message clear and helpful
- Canadian address rejected
- UK address rejected
- ZIP code format validated
- State validation works
- PIN code check enforces US only
- Checkout blocked for non-US
- Business rule enforced throughout
