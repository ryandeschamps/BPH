Test Script: TS-009 - Filter Product Search Results

Test Scenario: As a visitor or buyer, I want to apply filters to product search results, so that I can narrow down products based on my preferences.

Prerequisites:
- Product catalog contains multiple products with various attributes
- Products have different sizes, colors, price ranges, and brands
- User is on a product listing or search results page
- Website filtering functionality is enabled

Test Data:
- Search Term: "T-Shirt"
- Filter Criteria: Price range $20-$50, Size: Medium, Color: Blue
- Expected Results: Products matching all filter criteria

Test Steps:

GIVEN the user has searched for products or is viewing a category
WHEN the user is on the product listing page
THEN the user should see filter options displayed on the page (typically in a sidebar or top section)

GIVEN the user sees the filter options
WHEN the user views the available filters
THEN the filters should include options such as:
  - Price range (min-max or predefined ranges)
  - Size (S, M, L, XL, etc.)
  - Color (various colors)
  - Brand (if applicable)
  - Rating (if applicable)

GIVEN the user wants to filter by price
WHEN the user selects a price range (e.g., $20 - $50)
THEN the system should update the product listing
AND only products within the selected price range should be displayed
AND the total number of matching products should be updated

GIVEN the user wants to filter by size
WHEN the user selects a size (e.g., "Medium")
THEN the system should apply the size filter
AND only products available in Medium size should be displayed
AND the filter should work in combination with previously selected filters

GIVEN the user wants to filter by color
WHEN the user selects a color (e.g., "Blue")
THEN the system should apply the color filter
AND only products available in Blue color should be displayed
AND the filter should work cumulatively with other selected filters

GIVEN the user has applied multiple filters
WHEN all filters are applied (Price: $20-$50, Size: Medium, Color: Blue)
THEN the system should display only products matching ALL filter criteria
AND the product count should reflect the filtered results
AND the applied filters should be clearly visible (e.g., as tags or highlighted options)

GIVEN the user has applied filters
WHEN the user wants to remove a specific filter
THEN the user should be able to click on a remove/close icon for that filter
AND the system should update results to exclude that filter
AND remaining filters should still be applied

GIVEN the user has multiple filters applied
WHEN the user wants to clear all filters
THEN the user should see a "Clear All Filters" or "Reset" option
AND clicking it should remove all applied filters
AND the product listing should show all products again

GIVEN no products match the filter criteria
WHEN the user applies filters that result in zero products
THEN the system should display a message "No products found matching your filters"
AND the system should suggest removing some filters

Expected Result:
- Filter options are clearly visible and accessible
- User can apply single or multiple filters
- Product listing updates dynamically when filters are applied
- Multiple filters work cumulatively (AND logic)
- Applied filters are clearly indicated
- User can remove individual filters or clear all
- Product count updates to reflect filtered results
- Appropriate message shown when no products match filters
- Filtering works without requiring login

Validation Points:
- All filter categories are functional
- Filter options reflect available product attributes
- Product listing updates correctly when filters are applied
- Multiple filters work together (cumulative filtering)
- Filter removal works correctly
- Clear all filters functionality works
- Product count is accurate
- Filtered results match the selected criteria
- Filter state is maintained when navigating between pages
- Performance is acceptable when applying filters
- Empty results show appropriate message
