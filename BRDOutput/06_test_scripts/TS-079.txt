Test Script: TS-079 - Activate/Deactivate Sub-admin User

Test Scenario: As an admin user, I want to enable or disable sub-admin accounts, so that I can temporarily suspend access without deletion.

Prerequisites:
- Admin is logged in with super admin privileges
- Sub-admin users exist (both active and inactive)
- Status management functionality is enabled

Test Data:
- Active User: Sarah Johnson (subadmin@example.com), Status: Active
- Inactive User: Bob Wilson (bob@example.com), Status: Inactive

Test Steps:

GIVEN the admin is viewing the admin users list
WHEN the admin views user records
THEN each user should have a status indicator and action buttons

GIVEN the admin wants to deactivate an active user
WHEN the admin views "Sarah Johnson" with status "Active"
THEN a "Deactivate" button or toggle should be available

GIVEN the admin clicks "Deactivate"
WHEN the action is triggered
THEN the user status should be updated to "Inactive"
AND a success message should display "User deactivated successfully"

GIVEN the user is deactivated
WHEN "Sarah Johnson" tries to login
THEN the login should fail
AND an error message should indicate account is deactivated

GIVEN the admin wants to activate an inactive user
WHEN the admin views "Bob Wilson" with status "Inactive"
THEN an "Activate" button should be available

GIVEN the admin clicks "Activate"
WHEN the action is triggered
THEN the user status should be updated to "Active"
AND a success message should display "User activated successfully"

GIVEN the user is activated
WHEN "Bob Wilson" logs in
THEN the login should succeed
AND he should have access according to his role

Expected Result:
- Admin can deactivate active users
- Admin can activate inactive users
- Status changes are saved
- Deactivated users cannot login
- Activated users can login
- Success messages displayed

Validation Points:
- Status indicators are visible
- Activate/Deactivate buttons functional
- Status updates in database
- Success messages display
- Deactivated user login blocked
- Activated user login works
- Permissions applied correctly
