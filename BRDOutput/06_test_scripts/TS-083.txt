Test Script: TS-083 - Activate/Deactivate Role

Test Scenario: As an admin user, I want to enable or disable roles, so that I can control which roles are available for assignment.

Prerequisites:
- Admin is logged in with super admin privileges
- Roles exist (both active and inactive)
- Role status management is enabled

Test Data:
- Active Role: Content Manager, Status: Active
- Inactive Role: Legacy Manager, Status: Inactive

Test Steps:

GIVEN the admin is viewing the roles list
WHEN the admin views role records
THEN each role should have a status indicator

GIVEN the admin wants to deactivate a role
WHEN the admin clicks "Deactivate" for "Content Manager"
THEN the role status should update to "Inactive"
AND success message displayed

GIVEN the role is deactivated
WHEN creating or editing sub-admin users
THEN the inactive role should not appear in role dropdown

GIVEN the admin wants to activate a role
WHEN the admin clicks "Activate" for "Legacy Manager"
THEN the role status should update to "Active"
AND role should be available for assignment

Expected Result:
- Roles can be activated/deactivated
- Inactive roles not available for assignment
- Active roles available for assignment
- Status changes saved

Validation Points:
- Status indicators visible
- Activate/Deactivate buttons work
- Status updates in database
- Inactive roles hidden from dropdown
- Active roles appear in dropdown
- Success messages display
