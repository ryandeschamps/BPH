Test Script: TS-010 - Sort Product Search Results

Test Scenario: As a visitor or buyer, I want to sort product search results by various criteria, so that I can find products that best match my needs.

Prerequisites:
- Product catalog contains multiple products with varying prices and ratings
- User is on a product listing or search results page
- Website sorting functionality is enabled

Test Data:
- Category: Men's T-Shirts
- Products: At least 10 products with different prices and ratings
- Sort Options: Price (Low to High), Price (High to Low), Rating, Newest First

Test Steps:

GIVEN the user is viewing a product listing page (category, search results, or all products)
WHEN the user looks for sorting options
THEN the user should see a "Sort By" dropdown or sorting controls

GIVEN the user sees the sorting options
WHEN the user clicks on the "Sort By" dropdown
THEN the system should display available sorting options such as:
  - Price: Low to High
  - Price: High to Low
  - Newest First
  - Rating: High to Low
  - Featured/Recommended

GIVEN the user wants to sort by price (low to high)
WHEN the user selects "Price: Low to High" from the dropdown
THEN the system should reorder the products
AND products should be displayed with lowest priced items first
AND products should be displayed with highest priced items last

GIVEN the user wants to sort by price (high to low)
WHEN the user selects "Price: High to Low" from the dropdown
THEN the system should reorder the products
AND products should be displayed with highest priced items first
AND products should be displayed with lowest priced items last

GIVEN the user wants to sort by rating
WHEN the user selects "Rating: High to Low" from the dropdown
THEN the system should reorder the products
AND products with highest ratings should appear first
AND products with lowest or no ratings should appear last

GIVEN the user wants to see newest products
WHEN the user selects "Newest First" from the dropdown
THEN the system should reorder the products
AND most recently added products should appear first
AND older products should appear later

GIVEN the user has applied filters
WHEN the user applies a sort option
THEN the sorting should apply only to the filtered results
AND both filters and sorting should work together

GIVEN the user sorts products and navigates to next page
WHEN the user clicks on pagination controls (next page)
THEN the sort order should be maintained across pages
AND the selected sort option should remain active

GIVEN the user has sorted the products
WHEN the user wants to return to default sorting
THEN the user should be able to select a default option (e.g., "Featured" or "Recommended")
OR the user should be able to clear the sorting

Expected Result:
- Sort options are clearly visible and accessible
- User can sort by multiple criteria (price, rating, date)
- Products are correctly reordered based on selected sort option
- Sort order is maintained during pagination
- Sorting works in combination with filters
- Sort selection is clearly indicated
- Sorting works without requiring login
- Performance is acceptable when sorting large product sets

Validation Points:

- Price sorting (low to high) correctly orders products by ascending price
- Price sorting (high to low) correctly orders products by descending price
- Rating sorting correctly orders products by rating value
- Date sorting shows newest products first
- Sort order persists across pagination
- Sorting works with filtered results
- Selected sort option is visually indicated
- Sorting works for both visitors and logged-in users
- Product count remains accurate after sorting
- Page layout remains consistent after sorting
