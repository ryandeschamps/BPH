Test Script: TS-082 - Delete Role

Test Scenario: As an admin user, I want to remove roles that are no longer needed, so that I can keep the permission system organized.

Prerequisites:
- Admin is logged in with super admin privileges
- Deletable roles exist
- Role deletion functionality is enabled

Test Data:
- Role to Delete: Content Manager (not assigned to any users)

Test Steps:

GIVEN the admin is viewing the roles list
WHEN the admin views existing roles
THEN each role should have a "Delete" button

GIVEN the admin wants to delete a role
WHEN the admin clicks "Delete" for "Content Manager"
THEN a confirmation dialog should appear

GIVEN the role is not assigned to users
WHEN the admin confirms deletion
THEN the role should be deleted
AND success message displayed

GIVEN the role is assigned to users
WHEN the admin tries to delete
THEN a warning should appear
AND prevent deletion or require reassignment

Expected Result:
- Roles can be deleted
- Confirmation required
- Assigned roles handled appropriately
- Success message displayed

Validation Points:
- Delete button accessible
- Confirmation dialog appears
- Role deleted from database
- Success message displays
- Assigned role protection works
