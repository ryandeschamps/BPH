Test Steps:

GIVEN the user has completed address entry at checkout

THEN the following should be visible:
  - List of all items being purchased
  - Item quantities and prices

GIVEN the items section is displayed
WHEN the user reviews the items
THEN each item should show:
  - Product name
  - Selected variations (size, color)
  - Quantity
  - Unit price
  - Item total (quantity × unit price)

GIVEN the order summary shows pricing details
WHEN the user views the cost breakdown
THEN the Item Total should be $110.00 (sum of all item totals)
AND the Shipping Cost should be displayed (e.g., $10.00)
AND the Tax should be calculated and displayed (e.g., $8.80)
AND the Order Total should be $128.80 (Item Total + Shipping + Tax)

GIVEN the order summary includes addresses
WHEN the user reviews shipping information
THEN the billing address should be displayed
AND the shipping address should be displayed
AND both addresses should be accurate and complete

GIVEN the user wants to verify order details

THEN all information should be clearly organized:

AND clicking these should allow the user to make changes

GIVEN the calculations are displayed
WHEN the user verifies the math
THEN Item Total = $50.00 + $60.00 = $110.00
AND Tax = $110.00 × 8% = $8.80 (or applicable rate)
AND Order Total = $110.00 + $10.00 + $8.80 = $128.80
AND all calculations should be accurate
