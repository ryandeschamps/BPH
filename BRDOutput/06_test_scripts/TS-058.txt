Test Script: TS-058 - Add New Product Category

Test Scenario: As an admin user, I want to create new product categories, so that I can organize products effectively.

Prerequisites:
- Admin is logged in to admin panel
- Product catalog management section is accessible
- Category management functionality is enabled

Test Data:
- Category Name: Winter Collection
- Category Description: Products for winter season
- Category Status: Active
- Display Order: 5

Test Steps:

GIVEN the admin is logged in to the admin panel
WHEN the admin navigates to "Products" or "Catalog" section
THEN a "Categories" or "Product Categories" option should be visible

GIVEN the admin clicks on "Categories"
WHEN the categories page loads
THEN a list of existing categories should be displayed
AND an "Add New Category" or "Create Category" button should be available

GIVEN the admin clicks "Add New Category"
WHEN the category creation form opens
THEN the following fields should be available:
  - Category Name (text input)
  - Category Description (textarea)
  - Status (Active/Inactive dropdown or toggle)
  - Display Order (numeric input, optional)
  - Parent Category (dropdown, optional - for hierarchical categories)

GIVEN the admin wants to create a new category
WHEN the admin enters category information:
  - Category Name: "Winter Collection"
  - Description: "Products for winter season"
  - Status: "Active"
  - Display Order: "5"
AND clicks "Save" or "Create Category" button
THEN the system should validate all required fields

GIVEN the validation passes
WHEN the category is saved
THEN the new category should be created in the database
AND a success message should display "Category created successfully"
AND the admin should be redirected to the categories list

GIVEN the category is created
WHEN the admin views the categories list
THEN "Winter Collection" should be visible in the list
AND the status should show "Active"
AND the category should be available for product assignment

GIVEN the admin leaves required fields empty
WHEN the admin tries to save without entering category name
THEN a validation error should be displayed
AND the message should indicate "Category name is required"

GIVEN a category with the same name exists
WHEN the admin tries to create a duplicate category name
THEN a validation error should be displayed
AND the message should indicate "A category with this name already exists"

GIVEN the admin sets status to "Inactive"
WHEN the admin creates a category with inactive status
THEN the category should be created
BUT should not be visible to customers on the website

GIVEN the display order is specified
WHEN the admin enters display order "5"
THEN the category should be positioned according to the order
AND categories should be sorted by display order on the website

GIVEN parent category option is available (hierarchical)

AND should appear under the parent in the hierarchy
