Test Script: TS-060 - Activate/Deactivate Product Category

Test Scenario: As an admin user, I want to enable or disable product categories, so that I can control which categories are visible to customers.

Prerequisites:
- Admin is logged in to admin panel
- Product categories exist (both active and inactive)
- Category status management is functional

Test Data:
- Active Category: "Winter Collection", Status: Active
- Inactive Category: "Summer Clearance", Status: Inactive

Test Steps:

GIVEN the admin is viewing the categories list
WHEN the admin views category records
THEN each category should have a status indicator (Active or Inactive)
AND action buttons for status management should be available

GIVEN the admin wants to deactivate an active category
WHEN the admin views "Winter Collection" with status "Active"
THEN a "Deactivate" button, toggle, or status change option should be available

GIVEN the admin clicks "Deactivate"
WHEN the deactivation is triggered
THEN a confirmation dialog may appear asking "Are you sure you want to deactivate this category?"

GIVEN the admin confirms deactivation
WHEN the admin confirms the action
THEN the system should update the category status to "Inactive"
AND the database should be updated
AND a success message should display "Category deactivated successfully"

GIVEN the category has been deactivated
WHEN the admin views the categories list
THEN "Winter Collection" status should show "Inactive"
AND the action button should change to "Activate"

GIVEN the category is deactivated
WHEN customers browse the website
THEN "Winter Collection" category should not be visible in navigation
AND should not appear in category listings

GIVEN products exist in the deactivated category
WHEN the category is inactive
THEN products in this category should not be accessible via category browse
BUT products may still be searchable or accessible via direct link (based on product status)

GIVEN the admin wants to activate an inactive category
WHEN the admin views "Summer Clearance" with status "Inactive"
THEN an "Activate" button or toggle should be available

GIVEN the admin clicks "Activate"
WHEN the activation is triggered
THEN a confirmation dialog may appear

GIVEN the admin confirms activation
WHEN the admin confirms the action
THEN the system should update the category status to "Active"
AND the database should be updated
AND a success message should display "Category activated successfully"

GIVEN the category has been activated
WHEN the admin views the categories list
THEN "Summer Clearance" status should show "Active"
AND the action button should change to "Deactivate"

GIVEN the category is activated
WHEN customers browse the website
THEN "Summer Clearance" category should be visible in navigation
AND should appear in category listings
AND products in this category should be accessible

GIVEN the status change is via edit form
WHEN the admin edits a category
THEN the status can also be changed via the edit form
AND the same activation/deactivation logic applies

GIVEN sub-categories exist under a parent category
WHEN the admin deactivates a parent category
THEN the system should handle sub-categories appropriately:
  - Hide parent and all sub-categories
  OR
  - Prompt admin about sub-categories
  - Allow choice to deactivate sub-categories as well

Expected Result:
- Admin can view category status (Active/Inactive)
- Admin can deactivate active categories
- Admin can activate inactive categories
- Status changes are saved to database
- Success messages displayed after status change
- Deactivated categories hidden from customers
- Products in deactivated categories not browseable via category
- Activated categories visible to customers
- Status toggle works correctly
- Sub-categories handled appropriately

Validation Points:
- Category status is displayed correctly
- Activate/Deactivate buttons are functional
- Confirmation dialog appears (if implemented)
- Status update is saved to database
- Categories list reflects updated status
- Action button changes after status change
- Success message displays
- Deactivated category hidden from website navigation
- Deactivated category not in customer category lists
- Products in inactive category not accessible via category
- Activated category visible on website
- Activated category in navigation menu
- Products in active category accessible
- Status toggle works from list page
- Status can be changed from edit form
- Multiple categories can be managed independently
- Changes take effect immediately on website
- Sub-categories handled correctly (if hierarchical)
