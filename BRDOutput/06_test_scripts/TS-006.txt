Test Script: TS-006 - User Logout

Test Scenario: As a logged-in buyer, I want to logout from my account, so that I can secure my account when finished shopping.

Prerequisites:
- User has a registered and verified account
- User is currently logged in to the website
- User session is active

Test Data:
- Email: john.doe@example.com
- Password: Test@1234

Test Steps:

GIVEN the user is logged in to the website
WHEN the user is on any page of the website
THEN the user should see a "Logout" option in the navigation or account menu

GIVEN the user can see the logout option
WHEN the user clicks on their account name or profile icon
THEN a dropdown menu or account menu should be displayed
AND the menu should contain a "Logout" option

GIVEN the user sees the logout option in the menu
WHEN the user clicks on the "Logout" button or link
THEN the system should terminate the user's session
AND the system should clear session cookies
AND the system should clear any cached user data
AND the system should redirect the user to the homepage or login page
AND the user should no longer see their name in the navigation
AND the user should see "Login" or "Sign In" options instead of "Logout"

GIVEN the user has been logged out
WHEN the user tries to access account-specific pages (e.g., My Account, Orders, Wishlist)
THEN the system should redirect to the login page
AND the system should display a message "Please login to access this page" or similar

GIVEN the user has been logged out
WHEN the user clicks the browser's back button
THEN the system should not allow access to previously viewed account pages
AND the system should redirect to login page or display session expired message

GIVEN the user has been logged out
WHEN the user navigates to the login page
AND the user logs in again with valid credentials
THEN the user should be able to login successfully
AND a new session should be created

Expected Result:
- Logout option is visible to logged-in users
- User can successfully logout from any page
- User session is terminated properly
- Session cookies are cleared
- User is redirected to public page after logout
- Login/Sign In options are displayed after logout
- User cannot access protected pages after logout
- Back button does not allow access to session pages
- User can login again after logout

Validation Points:
- Logout option is accessible from all pages when logged in
- Clicking logout terminates the active session
- Session cookies are properly cleared
- User authentication status is reset
- UI updates to reflect logged-out state
- Protected routes require re-authentication after logout
- Browser back button does not bypass session security
- Shopping cart contents are preserved (or cleared, based on business rules)
- User can successfully login again with same credentials
- New session is independent of previous session
