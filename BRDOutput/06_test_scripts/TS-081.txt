Test Script: TS-081 - Edit Role Permissions

Test Scenario: As an admin user, I want to modify role permissions, so that I can adjust access levels as needed.

Prerequisites:
- Admin is logged in with super admin privileges
- Roles exist in the system
- Role edit functionality is enabled

Test Data:
- Existing Role: Content Manager
- Current Permissions: CMS Pages, Email Templates
- New Permission to Add: Customer Support View

Test Steps:

GIVEN the admin is viewing the roles list
WHEN the admin views existing roles
THEN each role should have an "Edit" button

GIVEN the admin wants to edit a role
WHEN the admin clicks "Edit" for "Content Manager"
THEN the role edit form should open

GIVEN the edit form is displayed
WHEN the admin views the form
THEN it should show:
  - Role Name (editable)
  - Description (editable)
  - Permissions list with current permissions checked

GIVEN current permissions are displayed
WHEN the admin views the permissions
THEN currently assigned permissions should be checked
AND unassigned permissions should be unchecked

GIVEN the admin wants to add permissions
WHEN the admin checks "View Support Requests"
AND clicks "Save Changes"
THEN the permission should be added to the role
AND success message displayed

GIVEN the admin wants to remove permissions
WHEN the admin unchecks a permission
AND saves
THEN the permission should be removed from the role

GIVEN the role is updated
WHEN users with this role login
THEN they should see updated access based on new permissions

Expected Result:
- Role edit form is accessible
- Current permissions are shown
- Permissions can be added or removed
- Changes are saved successfully
- Users get updated access

Validation Points:
- Edit button accessible
- Form pre-fills with current data
- Permissions correctly checked
