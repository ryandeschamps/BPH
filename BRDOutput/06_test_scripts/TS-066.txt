Test Script: TS-066 - Activate/Deactivate Product

Test Scenario: As an admin user, I want to enable or disable products in the catalog, so that I can control which products are available for purchase.

Prerequisites:
- Admin is logged in to admin panel
- Products exist (both active and inactive)
- Product status management is functional

Test Data:
- Active Product: "Men's Blue T-Shirt", Status: Active, SKU: TS-001
- Inactive Product: "Vintage Jacket", Status: Inactive, SKU: JK-099

Test Steps:

GIVEN the admin is viewing the products list
WHEN the admin views product records
THEN each product should have a status indicator (Active or Inactive)
AND action buttons for status management should be available

GIVEN the admin wants to deactivate an active product
WHEN the admin views "Men's Blue T-Shirt" with status "Active"
THEN a "Deactivate" button or toggle should be available

GIVEN the admin clicks "Deactivate"
WHEN the deactivation is triggered
THEN a confirmation dialog may appear

GIVEN the admin confirms deactivation
WHEN the admin confirms the action
THEN the system should update the product status to "Inactive"
AND the database should be updated
AND a success message should display "Product deactivated successfully"

GIVEN the product has been deactivated
WHEN the admin views the products list
THEN "Men's Blue T-Shirt" status should show "Inactive"
AND the action button should change to "Activate"

GIVEN the product is deactivated
WHEN customers browse the website
THEN "Men's Blue T-Shirt" should not appear in product listings
AND should not be searchable
AND direct links should show "Product not available" message
AND the product should not be purchasable

GIVEN the product is in customer's cart or wishlist
WHEN the product is deactivated
THEN it should be removed from active carts
OR marked as unavailable in cart/wishlist

GIVEN the admin wants to activate an inactive product
WHEN the admin views "Vintage Jacket" with status "Inactive"
THEN an "Activate" button or toggle should be available

GIVEN the admin clicks "Activate"
WHEN the activation is triggered
THEN a confirmation dialog may appear

GIVEN the admin confirms activation
WHEN the admin confirms the action
THEN the system should update the product status to "Active"
AND the database should be updated
AND a success message should display "Product activated successfully"

GIVEN the product has been activated
WHEN the admin views the products list
THEN "Vintage Jacket" status should show "Active"
AND the action button should change to "Deactivate"

GIVEN the product is activated
WHEN customers browse the website
THEN "Vintage Jacket" should appear in product listings
AND should be searchable
AND should be available for purchase
AND customers should be able to add it to cart

GIVEN the status change is via edit form
WHEN the admin edits a product
THEN the status can also be changed via the edit form
AND the same activation/deactivation logic applies

GIVEN the product has no stock
WHEN the admin activates a product with zero stock
THEN the product should become active
BUT may show as "Out of Stock" to customers
AND may not be purchasable until stock is added
