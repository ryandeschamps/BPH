Test Script: TS-059 - Edit Product Category

Test Scenario: As an admin user, I want to modify existing product categories, so that I can keep the catalog structure current.

Prerequisites:
- Admin is logged in to admin panel
- Product categories exist in database
- Category edit functionality is enabled

Test Data:
- Existing Category: "Winter Collection"
- Current Description: "Products for winter season"
- New Description: "Premium winter clothing and accessories"
- Current Status: Active
- New Display Order: 3

Test Steps:

GIVEN the admin is viewing the categories list
WHEN the admin views existing categories
THEN each category should have an "Edit" button or link

GIVEN the admin wants to edit a category
WHEN the admin clicks "Edit" for "Winter Collection" category
THEN the category edit form should open

GIVEN the edit form is displayed
WHEN the admin views the form
THEN the following fields should be available:
  - Category Name (text input)
  - Category Description (textarea)
  - Status (Active/Inactive)
  - Display Order (numeric input)

GIVEN the form fields are pre-filled
WHEN the admin views the edit form
THEN current category data should be displayed:
  - Category Name: "Winter Collection"
  - Description: "Products for winter season"
  - Status: "Active"

GIVEN the admin wants to update the category
WHEN the admin modifies the description to "Premium winter clothing and accessories"
AND changes display order to "3"
AND clicks "Save Changes" or "Update" button
THEN the system should validate all fields

GIVEN the validation passes
WHEN the update is processed
THEN the category should be updated in the database
AND a success message should display "Category updated successfully"
AND the admin should be redirected to categories list

GIVEN the category is updated
WHEN the admin views the categories list
THEN "Winter Collection" should show the updated description
AND the display order should be reflected in the list ordering

GIVEN the admin changes the category name
WHEN the admin updates the name from "Winter Collection" to "Winter Essentials"
AND saves the changes
THEN the category name should be updated
AND all products in this category should remain associated

GIVEN the admin changes status to "Inactive"
WHEN the admin sets status from "Active" to "Inactive"
AND saves the changes
THEN the category should be deactivated
AND should no longer be visible to customers on the website
BUT products should remain in the category

GIVEN the admin tries to use a duplicate name
WHEN the admin changes the name to match another existing category
THEN a validation error should be displayed
AND the message should indicate "A category with this name already exists"

GIVEN the admin leaves required fields empty
WHEN the admin clears the category name field
AND tries to save
THEN a validation error should be displayed
AND the message should indicate "Category name is required"

GIVEN category updates affect the website
WHEN the admin updates a category
THEN changes should be reflected on the customer-facing website
AND category navigation should update accordingly

THEN clicking it should discard changes
AND return to categories list without saving
