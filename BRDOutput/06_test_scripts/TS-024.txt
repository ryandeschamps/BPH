Test Script: TS-024 - Remove Item from Wishlist

Test Scenario: As a registered buyer, I want to delete items from my wishlist, so that I can keep my wishlist current with items I'm actually interested in.

Prerequisites:
- User is registered and logged in
- User has multiple items in wishlist
- Wishlist removal functionality is enabled

Test Data:
- Wishlist Items:
  - Product 1: Women's Floral Dress, $65.00
  - Product 2: Blue Denim Jacket, $79.99
  - Product 3: Red Summer Hat, $25.00
- Item to Remove: Red Summer Hat

Test Steps:

GIVEN the user is logged in and viewing their wishlist page
WHEN the user views the wishlist items
THEN each item should have a "Remove" button, link, or icon (e.g., trash icon, X button, or broken heart)

GIVEN the user wants to remove an item from wishlist
WHEN the user clicks the "Remove" button for "Red Summer Hat"
THEN a confirmation dialog may appear (optional) asking "Remove this item from wishlist?"
OR the item is removed immediately

GIVEN the removal is confirmed
WHEN the system processes the removal
THEN the system should delete the product from the user's wishlist
AND the wishlist page should update

GIVEN the item has been removed
WHEN the wishlist page refreshes or updates
THEN the "Red Summer Hat" should no longer be displayed in the wishlist
AND the remaining items (Women's Floral Dress and Blue Denim Jacket) should still be visible
AND a confirmation message should be displayed (e.g., "Item removed from wishlist")

GIVEN the wishlist item count was 3
WHEN one item is removed
THEN the wishlist count should update to 2
AND the wishlist icon in navigation should reflect the updated count

GIVEN the user removes another item
WHEN the user clicks "Remove" for "Blue Denim Jacket"
THEN the item should be removed
AND the wishlist should now contain only "Women's Floral Dress"
AND the wishlist count should update to 1

GIVEN the user has only one item left in wishlist
WHEN the user removes the last item "Women's Floral Dress"
THEN the item should be removed
AND the wishlist should be empty
AND the wishlist page should display "Your wishlist is empty"
AND a "Continue Shopping" or "Browse Products" button should be displayed

GIVEN an item was removed from wishlist
WHEN the user navigates to that product's detail page
THEN the "Add to Wishlist" button should be in default state (not filled/active)
AND the user should be able to add the product to wishlist again if desired

GIVEN the user removes an item
