Test Script: TS-046 - Admin Login to Admin Panel

Test Scenario: As an admin user, I want to login to the admin panel, so that I can manage the e-commerce platform.

Test Data:
- Admin Username: admin@example.com
- Admin Password: AdminPass@123
- Admin Role: Super Admin

Test Steps:

GIVEN the admin wants to access the admin panel
WHEN the admin navigates to the admin panel URL (e.g., /admin or /admin-panel)
THEN the admin login page should be displayed

GIVEN the admin login page is displayed
WHEN the admin views the page
THEN the following fields should be available:
  - Username or Email (text input)
  - Password (password input)
  - Login button
AND the page should be clearly branded as "Admin Panel" or "Admin Login"

GIVEN the admin wants to login
WHEN the admin enters valid credentials:
  - Username: "admin@example.com"
  - Password: "AdminPass@123"
AND clicks the "Login" button
THEN the system should validate the credentials

GIVEN the credentials are valid
WHEN the authentication is processed
THEN the system should verify the user has admin role
AND create an admin session
AND redirect to the admin dashboard

GIVEN the admin is logged in
WHEN the admin dashboard loads
THEN the admin should see:
  - Admin dashboard with navigation menu
  - Key statistics and metrics
  - Admin user name displayed
  - Logout option

GIVEN the admin enters incorrect password
WHEN the admin enters wrong password
AND clicks login
THEN an error message should be displayed
AND the message should indicate "Invalid username or password"
AND the admin should not be logged in

GIVEN the admin enters non-existent username
WHEN the admin enters a username that doesn't exist
AND clicks login
THEN an error message should be displayed
AND the message should indicate "Invalid username or password"

GIVEN the admin leaves fields empty
WHEN the admin tries to login without entering username or password
THEN validation errors should be displayed
AND the messages should indicate which fields are required

GIVEN a regular user tries to access admin panel
WHEN a buyer/customer user tries to login with their credentials
THEN the login should fail
OR the user should be redirected to customer login
AND an error message should indicate "Access denied. Admin access only."

GIVEN the admin is already logged in

THEN the admin should be automatically redirected to the admin dashboard
AND should not see the login form again
