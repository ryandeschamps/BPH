Test Script: TS-063 - Activate/Deactivate Product Sub-category

Test Scenario: As an admin user, I want to enable or disable product sub-categories, so that I can control catalog visibility.

Prerequisites:
- Admin is logged in to admin panel
- Sub-categories exist (both active and inactive)
- Sub-category status management is functional
- Parent categories exist

Test Data:
- Active Sub-category: "Casual Shirts" under "Men's Clothing", Status: Active
- Inactive Sub-category: "Vintage Collection" under "Men's Clothing", Status: Inactive

Test Steps:

GIVEN the admin is viewing the categories list with sub-categories
WHEN the admin views sub-category records
THEN each sub-category should have a status indicator (Active or Inactive)
AND action buttons for status management should be available

GIVEN the admin wants to deactivate an active sub-category
WHEN the admin views "Casual Shirts" with status "Active"
THEN a "Deactivate" button, toggle, or status change option should be available

GIVEN the admin clicks "Deactivate"
WHEN the deactivation is triggered
THEN a confirmation dialog may appear

GIVEN the admin confirms deactivation
WHEN the admin confirms the action
THEN the system should update the sub-category status to "Inactive"
AND the database should be updated
AND a success message should display "Sub-category deactivated successfully"

GIVEN the sub-category has been deactivated
WHEN the admin views the categories list
THEN "Casual Shirts" status should show "Inactive"
AND the action button should change to "Activate"

GIVEN the sub-category is deactivated
WHEN customers browse the website
THEN "Casual Shirts" should not appear under "Men's Clothing" navigation
AND should not be visible in sub-category listings

GIVEN products exist in the deactivated sub-category
WHEN the sub-category is inactive
THEN products should not be accessible via sub-category browse
BUT the parent category "Men's Clothing" should remain active
AND other active sub-categories should still be visible

GIVEN the admin wants to activate an inactive sub-category
WHEN the admin views "Vintage Collection" with status "Inactive"
THEN an "Activate" button or toggle should be available

GIVEN the admin clicks "Activate"
WHEN the activation is triggered
THEN a confirmation dialog may appear

GIVEN the admin confirms activation
WHEN the admin confirms the action
THEN the system should update the sub-category status to "Active"
AND the database should be updated
AND a success message should display "Sub-category activated successfully"

GIVEN the sub-category has been activated
WHEN the admin views the categories list
THEN "Vintage Collection" status should show "Active"
AND the action button should change to "Deactivate"

GIVEN the sub-category is activated
WHEN customers browse the website
THEN "Vintage Collection" should be visible under "Men's Clothing"
AND should appear in sub-category listings
AND products in this sub-category should be accessible

GIVEN the parent category is inactive
WHEN a sub-category is active but parent is inactive
THEN the sub-category should not be visible to customers
AND both parent and sub-category should be hidden

GIVEN the status change is via edit form
WHEN the admin edits a sub-category
THEN the status can also be changed via the edit form
AND the same activation/deactivation logic applies

Expected Result:
- Admin can view sub-category status
- Admin can deactivate active sub-categories
- Admin can activate inactive sub-categories
- Status changes are saved to database
- Success messages displayed
- Deactivated sub-categories hidden from customers
- Parent category remains unaffected
- Products in inactive sub-categories not browseable
