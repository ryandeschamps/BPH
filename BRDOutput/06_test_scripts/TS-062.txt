Test Script: TS-062 - Edit Product Sub-category

Test Scenario: As an admin user, I want to modify existing product sub-categories, so that I can maintain accurate catalog organization.

Prerequisites:
- Admin is logged in to admin panel
- Sub-categories exist in database
- Sub-category edit functionality is enabled
- Parent categories exist

Test Data:
- Parent Category: Men's Clothing
- Existing Sub-category: "Casual Shirts"
- Current Description: "Casual and everyday shirts for men"
- New Description: "Comfortable casual shirts for everyday wear"
- New Display Order: 2

Test Steps:

GIVEN the admin is viewing the categories list with sub-categories
WHEN the admin views "Casual Shirts" under "Men's Clothing"
THEN an "Edit" button or link should be available for the sub-category

GIVEN the admin clicks "Edit" for the sub-category
WHEN the edit form opens
THEN the following fields should be displayed:
  - Parent Category (dropdown)
  - Sub-category Name (text input)
  - Sub-category Description (textarea)
  - Status (Active/Inactive)
  - Display Order (numeric input)

GIVEN the edit form is pre-filled
WHEN the admin views the form
THEN current sub-category data should be displayed:
  - Parent Category: "Men's Clothing"
  - Sub-category Name: "Casual Shirts"
  - Description: "Casual and everyday shirts for men"
  - Status: "Active"

GIVEN the admin wants to update the sub-category
WHEN the admin modifies:
  - Description: "Comfortable casual shirts for everyday wear"
  - Display Order: "2"
AND clicks "Save Changes" or "Update" button
THEN the system should validate all fields

GIVEN the validation passes
WHEN the update is processed
THEN the sub-category should be updated in the database
AND a success message should display "Sub-category updated successfully"
AND the admin should be redirected to categories list

GIVEN the sub-category is updated
WHEN the admin views the categories list
THEN "Casual Shirts" should show the updated description
AND should be positioned according to the new display order

GIVEN the admin changes the sub-category name
WHEN the admin updates the name to "Men's Casual Shirts"
AND saves the changes
THEN the sub-category name should be updated
AND all products in this sub-category should remain associated

GIVEN the admin changes the parent category
WHEN the admin changes parent from "Men's Clothing" to "Unisex Clothing"
AND saves the changes
THEN the sub-category should be moved under the new parent
AND products should remain in the sub-category

GIVEN the admin changes status to "Inactive"
WHEN the admin sets status from "Active" to "Inactive"
AND saves the changes
THEN the sub-category should be deactivated
AND should not be visible to customers
BUT products should remain in the sub-category

GIVEN the admin tries to use a duplicate name
WHEN the admin changes the name to match another sub-category under the same parent
THEN a validation error should be displayed
AND the message should indicate "A sub-category with this name already exists under this parent"

GIVEN the admin leaves required fields empty
WHEN the admin clears the sub-category name
AND tries to save
THEN a validation error should be displayed
AND the message should indicate "Sub-category name is required"

GIVEN the admin wants to cancel changes
WHEN a "Cancel" button is available
THEN clicking it should discard changes
AND return to categories list without saving

Expected Result:
- Admin can access sub-category edit form
