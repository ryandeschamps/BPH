Test Script: TS-094 - Handle 100 Concurrent Users

Test Scenario: As a system, I want to support at least 100 users simultaneously, so that I can maintain acceptable performance during normal traffic.

Prerequisites:
- System is deployed and accessible
- Load testing tools available
- Performance monitoring enabled

Test Data:
- Concurrent Users: 100
- Test Duration: 5 minutes
- User Actions: Browse, Search, Add to Cart, Checkout

Test Steps:

GIVEN the load testing environment is prepared
WHEN 100 concurrent users are simulated
THEN the system should handle the load

GIVEN users are performing various actions
WHEN users simultaneously:
  - Browse product listings
  - Search for products
  - View product details
  - Add items to cart
  - Complete checkout
THEN all operations should complete successfully

GIVEN the system is under load
WHEN response times are measured
THEN average response time should be acceptable
AND no requests should timeout

GIVEN concurrent database operations occur
WHEN multiple users update cart, place orders
THEN data integrity should be maintained
AND no deadlocks or conflicts should occur

GIVEN the load test completes
WHEN results are analyzed
THEN the following should be verified:
  - Success rate: >99%
  - Error rate: <1%
  - Average response time: <2 seconds
  - No system crashes or failures

Expected Result:
- System supports 100 concurrent users
- All operations complete successfully
- Response times acceptable
- No data corruption
- System remains stable

Validation Points:
- Load test runs successfully
- 100 users simulated
- All user actions executed
- Success rate meets threshold
- Error rate below limit
- Response times acceptable
- Database integrity maintained
- No system failures
