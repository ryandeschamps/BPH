Test Script: TS-100 - Manage Products with SKU Codes

Test Scenario: As an admin user, I want to use SKU codes to identify and track products, so that I can manage inventory and orders efficiently.

Prerequisites:
- Admin is logged in to admin panel
- Product management accessible
- SKU system implemented

Test Data:
- Product: Men's Blue T-Shirt
- SKU: TS-MEN-BLU-001
- Category: Men's Clothing
- Size Variations: S, M, L, XL

Test Steps:

GIVEN the admin is adding a new product
WHEN the product creation form is displayed
THEN a "SKU Code" field should be available

GIVEN the admin enters product details
WHEN the admin fills in:
  - Product Name: "Men's Blue T-Shirt"
  - SKU: "TS-MEN-BLU-001"
  - Category: "Men's Clothing"
AND saves the product
THEN the SKU should be stored with the product

GIVEN the SKU must be unique
WHEN the admin tries to create another product with SKU "TS-MEN-BLU-001"
THEN a validation error should appear
AND the message should indicate "SKU code already exists"
AND prevent duplicate SKU creation

GIVEN the product has variations
WHEN the product has sizes S, M, L, XL
THEN each variation may have its own SKU:
  - TS-MEN-BLU-001-S
  - TS-MEN-BLU-001-M
  - TS-MEN-BLU-001-L
  - TS-MEN-BLU-001-XL
OR all variations may share the base SKU

GIVEN the admin views product list
WHEN the products are displayed
THEN the SKU code should be visible in the list
AND admin can search/filter by SKU

GIVEN the admin searches by SKU
WHEN the admin enters "TS-MEN-BLU-001" in search
THEN the matching product should be found
AND displayed in results

GIVEN orders contain SKU codes
WHEN the admin views order details
THEN each ordered item should display its SKU code
AND SKU should help identify exact product/variation

GIVEN inventory is tracked
WHEN stock levels are managed
THEN SKU codes should be used to identify items
AND inventory should be associated with SKU

GIVEN reports are generated
WHEN product reports are created
THEN SKU codes should be included
AND enable product tracking and analysis

OR kept internal for admin use only
