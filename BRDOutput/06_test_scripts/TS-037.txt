THEN the user should see a "My Orders" or "Order History" option

GIVEN the user clicks on "My Orders"
WHEN the order history page loads
THEN a list of all user's past orders should be displayed

GIVEN the order list is displayed

GIVEN multiple orders are displayed
WHEN the user views each order in the list
THEN each order should show:
  - Order number
  - Order date
  - Order status (Delivered, Shipped, In Process, Confirmed, etc.)
  - Total amount paid
  - Number of items or brief item description
  - "View Details" button or link

GIVEN the orders are listed
WHEN the user views the order list
THEN Order 1 should display: "ORD-2025-001 | Jan 15, 2025 | Delivered | $150.00"
AND Order 2 should display: "ORD-2025-002 | Jan 20, 2025 | Shipped | $89.99"
