Test Script: TS-020 - Remove Item from Shopping Cart

Test Scenario: As a registered buyer, I want to remove items from my shopping cart, so that I can only purchase items I actually want.

Prerequisites:
- User is logged in
- User has multiple items in shopping cart
- Cart removal functionality is enabled

Test Data:
- Cart Item 1: Blue T-Shirt, Quantity 2, Price $50.00
- Cart Item 2: Black Jeans, Quantity 1, Price $60.00
- Cart Item 3: Red Cap, Quantity 1, Price $15.00
- Initial Cart Total: $125.00

Test Steps:

GIVEN the user is logged in and viewing the shopping cart
WHEN the user views the cart items
THEN each item should have a "Remove" button, link, or icon (e.g., trash icon, X button)

GIVEN the user wants to remove an item from cart
WHEN the user clicks the "Remove" button for "Red Cap"
THEN a confirmation dialog may appear (optional) asking "Are you sure you want to remove this item?"
OR the item is removed immediately

GIVEN the user confirms removal (if confirmation dialog exists)
WHEN the user clicks "Yes" or "Remove"
THEN the system should remove the item from the cart

GIVEN the item has been removed
WHEN the cart page refreshes or updates
THEN the "Red Cap" item should no longer be displayed in the cart
AND the remaining items (Blue T-Shirt and Black Jeans) should still be in the cart
AND the cart subtotal should recalculate from $125.00 to $110.00
AND a confirmation message should be displayed (e.g., "Item removed from cart")

GIVEN the cart has been updated
WHEN the user views the cart item count
THEN the cart count should decrease from 3 items to 2 items
AND the cart icon in navigation should reflect the updated count

GIVEN the user removes another item
WHEN the user clicks "Remove" for "Black Jeans"
THEN the item should be removed
AND the cart should now contain only "Blue T-Shirt"
AND the cart subtotal should update to $50.00

GIVEN the user has only one item left in cart
WHEN the user removes the last item "Blue T-Shirt"
THEN the item should be removed
AND the cart should be empty
AND the cart page should display "Your cart is empty"
AND a "Continue Shopping" or "Browse Products" button should be displayed

GIVEN an item was accidentally removed
WHEN the user wants to add it back
THEN the user should navigate back to the product page
AND add the item to cart again
OR an "Undo" option may be available (optional feature)

GIVEN the user removes an item
WHEN the removal is processed
THEN the item should be removed from the database cart table
AND the removal should be permanent unless re-added

Expected Result:
- User can remove individual items from cart
- Remove button is clearly visible for each item
- Removed item disappears from cart immediately
- Cart subtotal recalculates correctly after removal

- Cart subtotal recalculates accurately
- Cart item count updates correctly
